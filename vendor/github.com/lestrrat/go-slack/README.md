# Status

* Many APIs are still unimplemented (please file an issue!)
* RTM events are not covered entirely yet (please file an issue!)

Missing parts are missing only because the author does not have immediate need for them. With proper prodding, I will gladly take on implementing them.

Please see [#4](https://github.com/lestrrat/go-slack/issues/4) for a list of currently known unimplemented methods.

# Features

## Auto-generated API

All of the APIs in this library is generated by a tool, reducing human errors.

## Google API style library

All of the APIs in this library resemble that of google.golang.org/api, and is very predictable across all APIs.

## Full support for context.Context

The API is designed from the ground up to integrate well with context.Context.

# Synopsis

Simple REST Client:

```go
package slack_test

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "github.com/lestrrat/go-slack"
)

func ExampleClient() {
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
  defer cancel()

  token := os.Getenv("SLACK_TOKEN")
  cl := slack.New(token)

  // check if we are connected
  authres, err := cl.Auth().Test().Do(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("failed to test authentication: %s\n", err)
    return
  }
  fmt.Printf("%#v\n", authres)

  // simplest possible message
  chatres, err := cl.Chat().PostMessage("@username").
    Text("Hello, World!").
    Do(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("failed to post messsage: %s\n", err)
    return
  }
  fmt.Printf("%#v\n", chatres)
}
```

# RTM

See the [README in the rtm/ directory](./rtm/README.md).

# Calling Conventions

The API is constructed along the same lines of Google API Go libraries (https://google.golang.org/api), so if you are familiar with that style you should have no problem. But if you have not used their API, I'm sure you're confused - I know I was when I first saw their API.

This section will walk you through how the APIs in this REST client generally work. The basic idea is that you have a central client, which you can create via `New`:

```go
  client := slack.New(token)
```

The client is nothing but a placeholder for other "services". For example, to
use the slack APIs for `chat.*` endpoints, lookup the `ChatService` object
which can be obtained by calling the `Chat()` method:

```go
  service := client.Chat()
```

The `ChatService` object can construct an intermediate object, which are called
the `Call` objects. These objects exist to accumulate parameters that you want to
ultimately call the API endpoint with.

In the initial call to construct the objects, you will have to enter the **mandatory** parameters. For example, to start a `PostMessage` call (which is supposed to access `chat.postMessage` endpoint), you do:

```go
  call := service.PostMessage(channel)
```

The `channel` parameter is required, so you must pass that to the `PostMessage` method (you would think that `text` is always required, but you could either provide `text`, or an _attachment_ with text, so it's not always the case)

Once you have the `call` object, you can specify additional parameters which are
optional. The following would specify a `text` attribute for this call.

```go
  call.Text(yourMessage)
```

Finally, when you are done tweaking your call object, you should call `Do`, which will fire the actual request.

```go
  res, err := call.Do(ctx)
```

And you are done. Don't for get to pass a `context.Context` to all `Do` calls.

Also, for your convenience these `call` object methods can all be chained. So the above example could look like the following:

```go
  res, err := client.Users().PostMessage(channel).Text(yourMessage).Do(ctx)
```

# Hacking

To add REST endpoints, edit [endpoints.json](endpoints.json), and then run 

```
make generate
```
